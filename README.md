## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Miyu Seki

Iâ€™m a third-year student at a vocational school in Fukuoka, studying software development and design.  
My main focus is **UI/UX design**, **rapid prototyping**, and **frontend development** using **React / TypeScript / Flutter**.  
I like building prototypes that turn ideas into something people can actually try out, learn from, and improve quickly.

### About me
- Working on **school projects, hackathons, and personal prototypes**  
- Interested in **human-computer interaction**, **real-time apps**, and **education/healthcare tech**  
- Enjoy the process of **design â†’ build â†’ test â†’ refine** for rapid learning and better user experiences  

> **Note on Contributions:**  
> My GitHub contributions may look small because most of my work has been in **private school repos** and **hackathon projects**.  
> Behind the scenes, Iâ€™ve been actively building prototypes, but many of them canâ€™t be made public yet.

*This README shows only a part of my work. Most school and team projects are private for now,  
but Iâ€™m looking forward to sharing more in the near future.*
